9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark Daniels is a carpenter who creates personalized house signs. He wants an application to compute the price of any sign a customer orders, based on the following factors:</strong>

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minimum charge for all signs is $30.

10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black Dot Printing is attempting to organize carpools to save energy. Each input record contains an employee‚Äôs name and town of residence. Ten percent of the company‚Äôs employees live in Wonder Lake; 30 percent live in the adjacent town of Woodstock. Black Dot wants to encourage employees who live in either town to drive to work together. Design a flowchart or pseudocode for the following:

b. A program that continuously accepts employee data until a sentinel value is entered, and displays a list of all employees who are carpool candidates. Make sure the decision-making process is as efficient as possible.

c. A program that continuously accepts employee data until a sentinel value is entered, and displays a list of all employees who are ineligible to carpool because they do not live in either Wonder Lake or Woodstock. Make sure the decision-making process is as efficient as possible.

11. &nbsp;Amanda Cho, a supervisor in a retail clothing store, wants to acknowledge high-achieving salespeople. Design a flowchart or pseudocode for the following:

a. A program that continuously accepts each salesperson‚Äôs first and last names, the number of shifts worked in a month, number of transactions completed this month, and the dollar value of those transactions. Display each salesperson‚Äôs name with a productivity score, which is computed by first dividing dollars by transactions and dividing the result by shifts worked. Display three asterisks after the productivity score if it is 50 or higher.

b. A program that accepts each salesperson‚Äôs data and displays the name and a bonus amount. The bonuses will be distributed as follows:

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the productivity score is 30 or less, the bonus is $25.

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the productivity score is 31 or more and less than 80, the bonus is $50.

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the productivity score is 80 or more and less than 200, the bonus is $100.

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the productivity score is 200 or higher, the bonus is $200.

c. Modify Exercise 11b to reflect the following new fact, and have the program execute as efficiently as possible:

¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixty percent of employees have a productivity score greater than 200.

<strong>Performing Maintenance</strong>

A file named MAINTENANCE04-01.jpg is included with your downloadable student files. Assume that this program is a working program in your organization and that it needs modifications as described in the comments (lines that begin with two slashes) at the beginning of the file. Your job is to alter the program to meet the new specifications

<strong>Find the Bugs</strong>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your downloadable files for Chapter 4 include DEBUG04-01.txt, DEBUG04-02.txt, and DEBUG04-03.txt. Each file starts with some comments that describe the problem. Comments are lines that begin with two slashes (//). Following the comments, each file contains pseudocode that has one or more bugs you must find and correct.

2&nbsp; &nbsp; Your downloadable files for Chapter 4 include a file named DEBUG04-04.jpg that contains a flowchart with syntax and/or logical errors. Examine the flowchart and then find and correct all the bugs.

<strong>Game Zone</strong>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Chapter 2, you learned that many programming languages allow you to generate a random number between 1 and a limiting value named limit by using a statement similar to randomNumber = random(limit). Create the logic for a guessing game in which the application generates a random number and the player tries to guess it. Display a message indicating whether the player‚Äôs guess was correct, too high, or too low. (After you finish Chapter 5, you will be able to modify the application so that the user can continue to guess until the correct answer is entered.)

2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create a lottery game application. Generate three random numbers, each between 0 and 9. Allow the user to guess three numbers. Compare each of the user‚Äôs guesses to the three random numbers and display a message that includes the user‚Äôs guess, the randomly determined three digits, and the amount of money the user has won, as shown in Figure 4-24.

Matching Numbers

Award ($)

Any one matching

10

Two matching

100

Three matching, not in order

1000

Three matching in exact order

1,000,000

No matches

0

Make certain that your application accommodates repeating digits. For example, if a user guesses 1, 2, and 3, and the randomly generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do not give the user credit for three correct guesses‚Äîjust one.

<strong>Up for Discussion</strong>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer programs can be used to make decisions about your insurability as well as the rates you will be charged for health and life insurance policies. For example, certain preexisting conditions may raise your insurance premiums considerably. Is it ethical for insurance companies to access your health records and then make insurance decisions about you? Explain your answer.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Job applications are sometimes screened by software that makes decisions about a candidate‚Äôs suitability based on keywords in the applications. Is such screening fair to applicants? Explain your answer.

3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Medical facilities often have more patients waiting for organ transplants than there are available organs. Suppose you have been asked to write a computer program that selects which of several candidates should receive an available organ. What data would you want on file to be able to use in your program, and what decisions would you make based on the data? What data do you think others might use that you would choose not to use?
